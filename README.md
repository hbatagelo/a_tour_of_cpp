My annotated companion code for the book [A Tour of C++, Second Edition](http://www.stroustrup.com/tour2.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup. 

I have changed the code snippets as an attempt to follow the most recent [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) and [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) guidelines when appropriate.

## Build Requirements

*   [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) 3.13 or greater.
